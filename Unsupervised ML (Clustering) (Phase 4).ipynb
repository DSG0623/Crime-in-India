This is rampant in many parts of India and officers are not held accountable for their actions. This leads to a lack of trust in the police and leads to more people taking matters into their own hands instead of relying on the police for protection. There is also a need to provide better training for police officers. This can help them to better understand their roles and responsibilities and to be prepared for different types of situations. This can also help them to be more effective in their work and to serve the public better.

Finally, more resources need to be allocated towards increasing public awareness around crime prevention, as this is key in helping reduce crime rates.\n",
